# properties-types-tests
This is an introduction to the property based view 
of a code base. 

Look around!  Let me know if I should change an explanation.
## Usage

`stack build ` will create the code, but generating the context
stuff is harder.  The main file is [slidex.tex](./presentation/slidex.tex)

I build it with texworks or auctex mode.  It uses MetaPost.  

[slidex.pdf](./presentation/slidex.pdf) is the output file.


## How to run tests

```
stack test 
```

Will run the tests that the presentation is discussing.
